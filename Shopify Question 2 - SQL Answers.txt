We write multiple Sub Queries here, first step comes as inner most query and the rest follows...
1. Get the customerID from Customer with country = Germany
2. Get the OrderID from Orders where CustomerID IN (values from prev step)
3. Get the ProductID and their count from OrderDetails by grouping
4. Order the above result in DESC and select top 1
5. From this we select only Product ID and Leave the Count
6. from the Products table, get the Product name for the obtained ProductID
